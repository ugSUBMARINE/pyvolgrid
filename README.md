# PyVolGrid

**PyVolGrid** is a Python package for estimating the **total volume of overlapping spheres** using a **grid-based numerical approach**.
It is intended for applications in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, and structural bioinformatics.

(Besides its potential usefullness, this package also served as a learning project for me to get more familiar with Python packaging and distribution of precompiled wheels.)
